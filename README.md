## Overview
The Car Shop Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ using Visual Studio 2022. It provides a comprehensive solution for managing the inventory of cars and the staff of a car shop. This project was developed as a learning exercise during the process of mastering C++ programming concepts.

## Key Features
- **Inventory Management:** Add, list, and delete cars from the inventory. Search for cars by make or model.
- **Staff Management:** Add, list, and delete managers from the staff roster. Sort managers by work experience.
- **Data Organization:** Sort cars by price or year of manufacture.
- **Information Retrieval:** Find the car with the highest price in the inventory. Display the year when the shop started its operations.
- **Persistence:** Save data modifications to files for future reference.

## Technologies Used
- **C++ Programming Language:** Utilized for its performance and versatility.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Implemented to organize code into reusable components.
- **File Input/Output (I/O):** Facilitated loading and saving data to files.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Used for managing resources at runtime.
- **Standard Template Library (STL):** Likely utilized for string manipulation and algorithms.
- **System Commands:** Employed for console screen clearing.
