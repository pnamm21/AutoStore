The Car Shop Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ using Visual Studio 2022. It provides a comprehensive solution for managing the inventory of cars and the staff of a car shop. This project was developed as a learning exercise during the process of mastering C++ programming concepts.

## Key Features
- **Inventory Management:** Add, list, and delete cars from the inventory. Search for cars by make or model.
- **Staff Management:** Add, list, and delete managers from the staff roster. Sort managers by work experience.
- **Data Organization:** Sort cars by price or year of manufacture.
- **Information Retrieval:** Find the car with the highest price in the inventory. Display the year when the shop started its operations.
- **Persistence:** Save data modifications to files for future reference.

## Technologies Used
